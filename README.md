# Brewery-Search

## Description 

This web application serves as a brewery finder. When you load the application you will see a homepage page displaying the title of the application, a search input to search for breweries by city, a search input to search for breweries by zipcode, and a random brewery button below. In addition to these form inputs, the weather is also shown on the homepage.

A back button on this page will return the user to the homepage.
